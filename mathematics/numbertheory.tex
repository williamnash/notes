\subsection{Geometric Series}
The geometric series is defined as 
\begin{align}
	\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} ar^n =a\Big( \frac{1-r^{N}}{1-r}\Big)
\end{align}
Which is only convergent for $r < 1$. To prove it, let's call whatever the value of the total series is equal to $s$, so we have
\begin{align}
	s = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ... + ar^{N-1}
\end{align}
Let's multiply it by $r$
\begin{align}
	rs =  ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ... + ar^{N}
\end{align}
We recognize that the portion on the right is basically the same as the earlier expression for $s$, so let's plug in exactly what that is
\begin{align}
	rs = (s - a) + ar^N
\end{align}
Rearranging this, we find
\begin{align}
	(r-1)s = a(r^N - 1)
\end{align}
Dividing through, we see that
\begin{align}
	\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} ar^n = s = a\Big( \frac{1-r^{N}}{1-r}\Big)
\end{align}


\subsection{Completing the Square}
If we have some function that looks like
\begin{align}
ax^2 + bx + c
\end{align}
and we want it to look like
\begin{align}
d(x+e)^2 + f
\end{align}
We have that 
\begin{align}
ax^2 + bx + c = dx^2 + 2ed x + de^2 + f
\end{align}
Matching powers of $x$, we get that
\begin{align}
a &= d\\
b &= 2ed\\
c &= de^2+f
\end{align}
Solving these gives us
\begin{align}
d = a && e =\frac{b}{2a}  && f = c-\frac{b^2}{4a}
\end{align}




\subsection{Trigonometric Identities}

\begin{align}
\sin(\alpha\pm\beta) = \sin\alpha\cos\beta\pm\cos\alpha\sin\beta\\
\cos(\alpha\pm\beta) = \cos\alpha\cos\beta\mp\sin\alpha\sin\beta
\end{align}

With these identities we can derive the double angle formula, setting $\alpha = \beta$ so
\begin{align}
\cos2\alpha &= \cos^2\alpha -\sin^2\alpha\\
&= 2\cos^2\alpha-1
\end{align}
The Law of Cosines is 
\begin{align}
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 -2ab\cos\theta
\end{align}
Where $\theta$ is the angle between $a$ and $b$. Can remember this because reduces to the Pythagorean Theorem for $\theta = \pi/2$ and when $\theta = \pi$ we have
\begin{align}
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 +2ab = (a+b)^2
\end{align}
A much simpler way to recover this same identity is to draw out the vectors themselves
\begin{align}
	\textbf{a} + \textbf{c} = \textbf{b} \rightarrow \textbf{c} = \textbf{a} - \textbf{b}
\end{align}
Looking at the square of this, we have
\begin{align}
	c^2 &= a^2 + b^2 - 2\textbf{a}\cdot\textbf{b}\\
	&= a^2 + b^2 -2ab\cos\theta 
\end{align}

You can always remember the derivatives of a trigonometric function by looking at it's Taylor expansion, and taking the derivative of that
\begin{align}
	\sin x &= x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} + ...\\
	\cos x &= 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{41} + ...
\end{align}
Taking the derivative of sin for instances gives us
\begin{align}
	\frac{d}{dx}\sin x &= \frac{d}{dx}\Big( x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} + ...\Big)\\
	&= 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{41} + ...\\
	&= \cos x
\end{align}

\subsection{Polynomial Algebra}

Can find roots of polynomial equations with
$$
\begin{array}{rc@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}}
& -x^2 +& x + &2 & \\ \cline{2-4}
\multicolumn{1}{r|}{x+1} &-x^3+ & 0 + & 3x +&2\\
-&-x^2 -&x  &\\ \cline{2-3}
& 0 +& x^2 &\\ 
-&  & x^2 +&x\\ \cline{3-4}
& & 0 +&2x &\\ 
-& &  &2x +&2\\ \cline{4-5}
& & & &0\\
\end{array}
$$

\section{Combinatorics}
A critical combinatorics formula is 
\begin{align}
{{n}\choose{k}} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\end{align}
Which tells us how may ways we can pick $k$ objects out of a total of $n$ of them. Obviously we should have $n>k$, so the number is positive, which means we should have $n$ on the top.


\subsection{Euclidean Algorithm}

If you have two numbers that you don't know the prime factorization of, one can find their greatest common denominator (qcd) using this algorithm. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose two numbers $N_1, N_2$ 
\begin{itemize}
\item	e.g. $57, 27$
\end{itemize}
\item Subtract the smaller of the two from the larger $\max(N_1,N_2) -\min(N_1,N_2)$
\begin{itemize}
\item	$57 -27 = 30$
\end{itemize}
\item Continue to subtract $\min(N_1,N_2)$ until you're about to get negative numbers
\begin{itemize}
\item $30 -27 = 3$
\end{itemize}
\item This number is the greatest common denominator of the two
\begin{itemize}
\item $3\times 19 = 57$
\item $3 \times 9 = 27$
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Distributions}
\subsection{Binomial Distribution}
The Binomial distribution is given by
\begin{align}
P(k;n,p) = \begin{pmatrix}
n\\
k
\end{pmatrix}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
\end{align}
Where 
\begin{align}
\begin{pmatrix}
n\\
k
\end{pmatrix} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\end{align}
Which tells us, if we try something $n$ times, each of which has a chance $p$ of succeeding, that we get $k$ successes. 

\subsection{Poisson Distribution}
The Poisson distribution is used to describe the distribution of discrete events over a given time or space interval. Consider a radioactive decay process which has $\lambda$ decays per minute. 

For a process which obey's Binomial statistics, we have a set amount of times the event could happen $n$ and a proportion of successes $k$. For a Poisson process the time or space interval could in principle be broken up infinitely, making it such that we don't just count over a set number of dice rolls, effectively infinitely many of them. Thus we take the limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ of the Binomial distribution with
\begin{align}
p = \frac{\lambda}{n}
\end{align}
Which tells us that the probability of the event happening at any given time is $0$, but as we will see, will give us a property such that a finite amount of events are seen when we are done counting. Mathematically we find

\begin{align}
P(k; \mu) &= \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-k+1)}{k!}\left(\frac{\lambda}{n}\right)^k\left(1-\frac{\lambda}{n}\right)^{n-k}\\
&= \lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{n^k}{k!}\frac{\lambda^k}{n^k}\left(1-\frac{\lambda}{n}\right)^{n-k}
\end{align}
Using the definition of the exponential function we arrive at the Poisson distribution with
\begin{align}
P(k; \lambda) = \frac{\lambda^ke^{-\lambda}}{k!}
\end{align}

Thus the Poisson distribution is a limiting case of the Binomial distribution when the number of dice rolls is infinite, but the amount of events we observe remain finite.

In counting experiments, it is often useful to know that if 0 events are observed coming from a Poisson distribution, the one-sided 95\% upper limit on the number of events is $\approx 3$, which is consistent with
\begin{align}
	\frac{3^0e^{-3}}{0!} \approx 0.05
\end{align}
Since the confidence interval tells us a model with true parameter $\lambda=3$ has a 5\% chance to see 0 events. In particle physics, $\lambda=3$ is held as a the benchmark for if your theory is testable or not, if $\lambda < 3$ you have a large chance that even if your theory is correct, you would still see nothing. 



\subsection{Gaussian Distribution}
Another distribution shows up in the case where $\lambda$ becomes so large that Stirling's approximation (Section \ref{stirling}) becomes valid. If we take a Poisson distribution with  $k = \lambda(1+\delta) \equiv x$ with $\lambda \gg 1, \delta \ll 1$ we can write
\begin{align}
	P(x; \lambda) &= \frac{\lambda^xe^{-\lambda}}{x!}\\
	&= \frac{\lambda^{\lambda(1+\delta)}e^{-\lambda}}{\lambda(1+\delta)!}
\end{align}
Using Stirling's approximation, one has
\begin{align}
		P(x; \lambda) &\approx \frac{\lambda^{\lambda(1+\delta)}e^{-\lambda}}{\sqrt{2\pi}e^{-\lambda(1+\delta)}(\lambda(1+\delta))^{\lambda(1+\delta)+1/2}}\\
		&\approx \frac{e^{-\lambda\delta}}{\sqrt{2\pi\lambda}} (1+\delta)^{-\lambda(1+\delta)-1/2}
\end{align}
Expanding the last term around $\delta=0$, we have
\begin{align}
	(1+\delta)^{-\lambda(1+\delta)-1/2} &\approx 1 + \delta*(\lambda+1/2) + \dots
\end{align}

In summary:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Poisson is limit of binomial for $p$ small and $n\gg \mu$
	\item Gaussian is limit of Poisson for large $\mu$
	\item Gaussian is limit of binomial for large $\mu=np$
\end{itemize}
