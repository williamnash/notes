# Build
This repository contains a collection of notes I have taken starting in 2017. They are kept in LaTeX for organization and self-reference. 
With [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) installed, create the two PDFs using

```bash
pdflatex mathematics.tex
pdflatex physics.tex
```

This will produce corresponding documents of the same name.
